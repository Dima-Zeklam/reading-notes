## Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

![Don't Repeat Yourself](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*qIS9MRHvCR5g-CgRU_cAQw.png)

Is a software development principle,  is the principle of reducing repetition in the code, referring back to a single source of reusable code whenever you need it.
Duplication in process is also waste if it can be automated.
##### Why you don't hava to repeat Yourself?
When you write code that performs the same tasks over and over again, any modification of one task requires the same change to be made to every single instance of that task. Editing every instance of a task is a lot of work.
Instead, you can create functions that perform those tasks, using sets of arguments or inputs to specify how the task is performed.


##### Advantages of DRY
1. Maintainability
2. Readability 
3. Reuse
4. Cost
5. Testing


[Once and Only Once](https://deviq.com/principles/once-and-only-once) can be considered a subset of the DRY principle.

## Rule of three
The “rule of three” is based on the principle that things that come in threes are inherently funnier, more satisfying, or more effective than any other number. was introduced by Martin Fowler in his text "Refactoring" and attributed to Don Roberts.

Also is a code refactoring rule to  to decide when a replicated piece of code should be replaced by a new procedure. It states that you are allowed to copy and paste the code once, but that when the same code is replicated three times, it should be extracted into a new procedure.

## You aren't gonna need it (YAGNI)
"Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them."
Is a principle of improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements.

As **YAGNI** helps avoid spending time on features that may not be used, the main features of a program are better developed and less total time is spent on each release

## Minimum viable product(MVP)

Minimum Viable Product or **MVP** is the most basic version of the product which the company wants to launch in the market.

**Purposes:**
- Accelerate learning
- Reduce wasted engineering hours
- Get the product to early customers as soon as possible
- Base for other products
- To establish a builder's abilities in crafting the product required
- Brand building very quickly
