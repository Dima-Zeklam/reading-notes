## Some example
* The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:

 `h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}`

* A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other

  `h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}
p {
    color: black;
}`

* Example on how to write comment :

 `/* This is a single-line comment */`

 * The *list-style-type* property specifies the type of list item marker.
The following example shows some of the available list item markers:

 `ul.a {
  list-style-type: circle;
}`

 `ul.b {
  list-style-type: square;
}`

 `ol.c {
  list-style-type: upper-roman;
}`

 `ol.d {
  list-style-type: lower-alpha;
}`
