# HTML 
You may know that HTML
stands for HyperText Markup
Language. The HyperText part
refers to the fact that HTML
allows you to create links that
allow visitors to move from one
page to another quickly and
easily. A markup language allows
you to annotate text, and these
annotations provide additional
meaning to the contents of a
document. If you think of a web
page, we add code around the
original text we want to display
and the browser then uses
the code to display the page
correctly. So the tags we add are
the markup.
## How people access the web?
* People can access  the web by using devices such as desktop computer, laptops, tablets, mobile phones, each one have a different screen size and some have faster connections to the web than others.

* People use software called **web browser**, like Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, and Opera to access the websites.
* **Web servers** are special computer that are constantly connected to the Internet, and are optimized to send web pages out to people who request them.

* Use screen reader is a program that read a content of a computer screen to users, they commonly used by people who have a virtual impairment also can be used for people are unable to read a screen such as when they are driving or jogging.

## How website are created?
 The web browser interprets the HTML and CSS code to create the page that you see.
Small websites are often written just using HTML and CSS. 
Larger websites — in particular those that are updated regularly and use a [content management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) **(CMS)**, blogging tools, or e-commerce software — often make use of more complex
technologies on the web server, but these technologies are actually used to produce HTML
and CSS that is then sent to the browser.
Larger, more complex sites like these may use a database to store data, and programming
languages such as PHP, ASP.Net, Java, or Ruby on the web server.

## How the web works?

When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. 
In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a **Domain Name System (DNS)** server, the **Domain Name System (DNS)** is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols.

## Structure
In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey and to navigate around the document.
The structure is very similar online

The use of headings and subheadings in any document often reflects a hierarchy of information. For example, a document might start with a large heading, followed by an introduction or the most important information. This might be expanded upon under subheadings lower down on the page. When using a word processor to create a document, we separate out the text to give it structure. Each topic might have a new paragraph, and each section can have a heading to describe what it covers.

HTML Describes the Structure of Pages, the HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets — these are called HTML elements. 
Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags, so elements used to Describe the Structure of Pages.

Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.

##### Opening Tag: `<p>`
##### Closing Tag: `</p>`

## Attributes 
Attributes provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a *name* and a *value*,
separated by an equals sign.

## Body, Head & Title in HTML

You met the **<body>** element
in the first example we created.
Everything inside this element is
shown inside the main browser
window.

Before the <body> element you
will often see a **<head>** element.
This contains information
about the page (rather than
information that is shown within
the main part of the browser
window that is highlighted in
blue on the opposite page).
You will usually find a <title>
element inside the <head>
element.

The contents of the **<title>**
element are either shown in the
top of the browser, above where
you usually type in the URL of
the page you want to visit, or
on the tab for that page (if your
browser uses tabs to allow you
to view multiple pages at the
same time).

## Code in a Content Management System
The advantage of this approach is that people who do not know how to write web pages can add information to a website and it is also possible to change the presentation of something in the template, and it will automatically update every page that uses that template. If you imagine an e-commerce store with 1,000 items for sale, just altering one template is a lot easier than changing the page for each individual product. In systems like this, when you have a large block of text that you can edit, such as a news article, blog entry or the
description of a product in an e-commerce store, you will often see a text editor displayed.
