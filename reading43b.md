# OSS Contributions

The term **“open source”** refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.
Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.
**“Source code”** is the part of software that most computer users don’t ever see; it’s the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software — a “program” or “application” — works.

## Definition of Contributions
Contributions are "more than just code" and are often times hard to measure. Our team tries to start with a small subset and update this section over time.

1. Source Code
2. cumentation
3. Tutorials and blog posts
4. Workshops and trainings
5. Issue discussion, resolving bugs and suggesting feature design/architecture
6. Package and release distribution
7. Help on community forums and social media

## What Motivates a Developer to Contribute to Open-Source Software?
There are a lot of enthusiasts who simply believe that code should be open. They’re idealists who want to make the world a better place, and it drives them to contribute code. The desire to share can be a powerful motivator.

OSS gives you a great start. Beginners might start by fixing minor things, such as a bug in a library, sending a pull request, or even writing a piece of documentation. However, beginner developers can also learn to write so-called `“clean code”` code that is readable and maintainable while contributing to open source projects. When developers realize that their code is exposed to the world, it makes them focus on making that code easy to understand and support.

## Ways to contribute to open source projects
1. Create your own open source project
2. Create open source alternatives to commercial software
3. Contribute to existing open source projects
