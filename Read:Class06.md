### 1. What is node.js?
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. 

### 2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
Chrome V8 is a JavaScript engine, which means that it executes JavaScript code. Originally, JavaScript was written to be executed by web browsers. Chrome V8, or just V8, can execute JavaScript code either within or outside of a browser, which makes server-side scripting possible.
### 3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests. In other words, Node.js wastes no time or resources on waiting for I/O requests to return.

### 4. What is npm?
**Node Package Manager** s the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client.
### 5. What version of node are you running on your machine?
v14.17.1
### 6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?
6.14.13
### 7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?
npm install -g jshint
### 8. What is node used for?
Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser. Node can, therefore, be used to write server-side applications with access to the operating system, file system, and everything else required to build fully-functional applications.

### What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

### In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
Work environment readiness

### How does pair programming work?
two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
