# What Google Learned About Teams

Team members at Google are challenged in much the same way as nearly everyone else in corporate life. To get things done, they need to come together fast and tackle complex tasks that have no easy solutions.


### The researchers at Google describe two factors that seem to make the biggest difference in creating psychologically safe environments for collaboration: 

1. relatively equivalent air time among all team members in their discussions

2. a high overall level of social sensitivity 


### Safety Starts with Leaders
Here are three essentials for leadership that make a difference:

1. **Develop clear goals and ground rules**

People in teams need enough common focus to feel competent to do the work at hand--hard to find in a world that is always shifting under their feet. Whether it’s stated outcomes for a last-minute meeting, short-term milestones on a project path, or high level objectives in a charter, effective teams share a common view of what they are trying to accomplish. Period. 

**Psychological safety** cannot exist in an on-going state of ambiguity. While they may not know what the future will look like in a month or a year, they can be clear about the nature and scope of what they are working on right now. If it needs to change, so be it—and that requires a discussion, some decision-making, and a collective reset. 


2. **Actively commit to creating psychological safety**

Google is hardly packed with touchy-feely types who expect to be talking about emotions at work. However, one leader described the value of having actual data that demonstrated the importance of paying attention to the subtle or even blatant barriers to people’s experience of safety on a team. The most common: Members getting shut down without a hearing on a controversial opinion, or being marginalized because of stylistic differences. 


3. **Take a hard look in a good mirror**

Having the ability to see their impact on others is the place to start. A leader may truly believe in the power of collaboration, understand the importance of psychological safety on a team, AND continue to act in ways that create the opposite effect. I am continually astounded by how hard it can be for well-intentioned people to change their habits and patterns.
