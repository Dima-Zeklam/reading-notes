# Android Monetization
Android Monetization is a technique that refers to monetizing Android apps. Monetizing generally means displaying advertisements and generating income when users interact with an ad or see one.

## Sell goods or services through your app
Sell digital goods or services with Google Play's billing system

Developers who distribute their app through Google Play are required to use Google Play's billing system to sell in-app content. Items that require developers to use Google Play's billing system include the following:

*  Virtual game products
* App functionality or content
* Subscription services
* Cloud software products
* Sell physical goods or services with Google Pay

*Google Pay* is a mobile service that enables users to purchase products and services using a compatible android phone with an NFC chip. You can also use Google Pay with a tablet or watch. This online payment system and digital wallet provides a convenient solution for customers in the digital world.

### Products where we recommend developers use Google Pay include the following:

* Retail merchandise
* Physical services
* One-time membership fees or recurring dues
* Electronic bill payment

### Other app monetization options

* Advertising
* Paid apps

### There are 7 popular different types of ads that you need to be aware of when monetizing your app:

* Banner Ads - Those are the ads that you see all over the web. They usually appear at the top or the bottom of the screen.
* Interstitial Ads - Those ads pop up during the transitions such as between screens, at the launch of the app, or at the end of a certain task.
* Video Ads - Those are video-based ads that pop-up in the app when a certain event or action is triggered.
* Dialog Ads - Those ads are usually shown as boxes that ask the user to check the website or the app of the advertiser.
* Offer Wall Ads - Each of those ads displays a single in-app interstitial which shows multiple promotional offers.
* SmartWall Ads - Those ads can take the shape of any format based on a triggered action or a certain factor.
* Rich Media Ads - Those are interactive ads that behave differently depending on the user input.

### Best practices for setting your initial monetization strategy
* Research other apps in your category
* Think about how your app will be used
* Make use of natural extensions
* Consider your cost structures: If you have significant recurring content costs, consider using subscriptions. Use a free trial period to encourage uptake.
* Consider your audience
* Consider local factors when setting prices
