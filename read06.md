### JavaScript s a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

### JavaScript is used to create client-side dynamic pages.

### JavaScript is an object-based scripting language which is lightweight and cross-platform.

### JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated language. The JavaScript Translator (embedded in the browser) is responsible for translating the JavaScript code for the web browser.

## There are following features of JavaScript:
1. #### All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.
2. #### JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.
3. #### JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the operation).
4. #### JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.
5. #### It is a light-weighted and interpreted language it is a case-sensitive language.
6. #### JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.
7. #### It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.

## JavaScript is used to create interactive websites. It is mainly used for:
* **Client-side validation,**
* **Dynamic drop-down menus,**
* **Displaying date and time,**
* **Displaying pop-up windows and dialog boxes (like an alert * dialog box, confirm dialog box and prompt dialog box),**
*  **Displaying clocks etc.**

## JavaScript variables can hold many data types: numbers, strings, objects and more: 
                                                            
>`Var length = 16;                               // Number`

>`var lastName = "Johnson";                      // String`

>`var x = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};    // Object`


## JavaScript Function
**A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.**

**A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).**

>`function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
}`

## JavaScript Date Input


#### There are generally 3 types of JavaScript date input formats:


Type |	Example
------|--------
ISO Date|	"2015-03-25" (The International Standard)
Short Date|	"03/25/2015"
Long Date	|"Mar 25 2015" or "25 Mar 2015"

## Errors Will Happen!
**When executing JavaScript code, different errors can occur.**

**Errors can be coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong input, and other unforeseeable things.**


**JavaScript catches adddlert as an error, and executes the catch code to handle it.**

**The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.**

***The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.**

>`try {
  Block of code to try
}
catch(err) {
  Block of code to handle errors
}`

**JavaScript Throws Errors When an error occurs, JavaScript will normally stop and generate an error message.**

**The technical term for this is: JavaScript will throw an exception (throw an error). THe exception can be a JavaScript String, a Number, a Boolean or an Object: **

> `throw "Too big";    // throw a text`

> `throw 500;          // throw a number`
