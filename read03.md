## What is HTML ?
### HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content, we mean with markup Tags like <p>,<body> and HTML is not WYSWYG and use HTML to structure and content to our pages.

## The main parts of our element are as follows:
1. *The opening tag* : This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets.

2. *The closing tag* : This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
3. *The content*: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
4. *The element*: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:

-----
### An attribute should always have the following:
#### 1. A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
#### 2. The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
#### 3. The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.


## What UX mean ?

### User experience [UX](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-ux-designer/) refers to any interaction a user has with a product or service. UX design considers each and every element that shapes this experience, how it makes the user feel, and how easy it is for the user to accomplish their desired tasks. This could be anything from how a physical product feels in your hand, to how straightforward the checkout process is when buying something online.
-----
### The gole of UX is :
#### To create easy, efficient,relevant and all-round pleasant experiences for the user.

# Wireframe 
### is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. 

## What is a commonly-used argument for wireframing ?
### is that if a user doesn’t know where to go on a plain hand-drawn diagram of your site page, then it is irrelevant what colors or fancy text eventually get used. A button or call to action needs to be clear to the user even it’s not brightly colored and flashing.

## Examples of wireframes
